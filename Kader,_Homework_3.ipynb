The total returns that are expected from the yield to maturity of a bond include the purchase price, face value (par value), and the time to maturity. The YTM is calculated based on the discount to its face value of the sale price, and does not pay periodic interest. Since the YTM of the zero-coupon is 5%, the effective annualized return is 5%. This return assumes compounding interest once per year and is a reflection of the bond's YTM as well as annual growth rate."

Without knowing the future yield to maturity or interest rates at the end of the 2-year period, we cannot accurately calculate the bond's price and, consequently, the return if sold at that time. The effective annualized return over a partial period for a zero-coupon bond would typically require knowing the bond's selling price at the end of that period. Since the bond's future price depends on the interest rates at the future time (which are not provided), we cannot solve for the effective annualized return over just 2 years without additional information about the future interest rates or the bond's future selling price."

        "When the Federal Reserve increases the lending rate, commonly referred to as the federal funds rate, it directly affects the cost of borrowing across the economy. This includes the interest rates on credit cards. Here's how an increase in the federal funds rate can affect credit card interest rates and consumer spending behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact on Credit Card Interest Rates**\n",
        "1. Increase in Credit Card APRs: Credit card interest rates are often variable and tied to the prime rate, which moves in tandem with the federal funds rate. As the Federal Reserve raises the lending rate, banks will increase the prime rate, which in turn causes credit card Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) to rise. Therefore, if the Federal Reserve continues to increase the lending rate, it's reasonable to expect that credit card interest rates will continue to climb from their current levels, including the average rate you mentioned of 22.91%.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Wider Credit Spreads: During periods of tightening monetary policy (when the Fed raises rates), there's often an increased risk of default as borrowing costs rise. Credit card issuers might increase rates more than the rise in the federal funds rate to compensate for this heightened risk, widening the spread between the cost of funds for the bank and the interest rate charged to consumers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact on Consumer Spending Behavior**\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduced Credit Card Usage: As credit card interest rates rise, consumers may become more hesitant to carry balances on their credit cards due to the higher cost of borrowing. This could lead to a reduction in credit card usage for discretionary spending.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Shift Towards Debit or Cash: Consumers might shift their payment preferences towards debit cards or cash to avoid accruing interest on credit card balances. This shift could be more pronounced for non-essential purchases or in cases where consumers are more sensitive to the impact of interest charges.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Increased Focus on Debt Repayment: With higher interest rates, the cost of carrying credit card debt increases, which could lead consumers to prioritize paying down existing credit card debt. This might involve reallocating spending towards debt repayment, possibly at the expense of discretionary spending.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Budgeting and Saving: Consumers might adopt more stringent budgeting practices, cutting back on non-essential expenses to avoid accruing high-interest debt. There may also be an increased emphasis on building an emergency savings fund to reduce the need to rely on credit cards for unexpected expenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the Federal Reserve raises the lending rate, it's likely that both credit card interest rates will increase, and consumer spending behavior will shift towards more cautious financial practices. These changes can have a broad impact on the economy, affecting everything from individual financial health to the performance of various sectors dependent on consumer spending."
